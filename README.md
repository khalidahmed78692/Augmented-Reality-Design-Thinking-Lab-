# Augmented-Reality-Design-Thinking-Lab-
This is a part of our design thinking lab, where AR was one of the component. We basically build the website, animated videos and AR effect. So this repo contains only the AR effect.


Just scan any one QR code and you'll be directed to a website named MyWebAr.com. So give access of your phone camera and keep your camera to the QR code and you'll be mesmerize to see the India map, UN Headquarters and Mahatma Gandhi Ji in 3D view, which actually is not there in the reality but because of MyWebAr.com you can see it. And you can click on the AR effect like if you click on India map, you'll be directed to a wikipedia page of India map also if you click on Mahatma Gandhi Ji you can hear his speech.
